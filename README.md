[Automata Sim](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-67563176c2b481918953105d46331620-automata-sim) is specifically designed to assist with the creation, simulation, and understanding of finite state machines (FSMs) and related computational models like deterministic finite automata (DFAs), nondeterministic finite automata (NFAs), and Turing machines. Its primary purpose is to provide an interactive platform for defining these automata by guiding users through the process of specifying key components, such as states, input alphabets, transitions, and accepting states. Through a step-by-step approach, it ensures clarity and accuracy in building these models, offering examples, visual aids like tables, and explanations to accommodate users with varying levels of expertise in automata theory.

Once an automaton is defined, Automata Sim enables users to simulate its behavior by processing input strings and tracing the state transitions. It validates inputs against the defined alphabet, illustrates state paths for DFAs and NFAs, and determines whether a string is accepted or rejected based on the final state. Detailed feedback is provided to debug potential issues or refine the automaton's design. This tool is an excellent resource for students, educators, or professionals seeking to explore computational models interactively and deepen their understanding of formal languages and automata.
